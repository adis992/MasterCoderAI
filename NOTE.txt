# NOTE

This file contains quick instructions on how to launch the React Web UI (webui).

1. Using Makefile (recommended):

   From the project root directory:
   ```bash
   make run-webui
   ```

   This will:
   - cd into `webui/`
   - install npm dependencies
   - start the development server on http://localhost:3000

2. Manually:

   ```bash
   cd webui
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

   Then open your browser at:
   http://localhost:3000

---

If you run into errors, make sure:
- Node.js and npm are installed (v16+ recommended)
- The `webui/` folder exists and contains `package.json`
- You have network access to fetch required packages

Enjoy your Web UI debugging and development!
